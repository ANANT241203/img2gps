Problem Definition and Scope: The goal of this project is to build a computer vision
model that could predict the GPS locations from any images taken from campus. To
make it more feasible, we define the testing region to be on Pennâ€™s campus in between the
rectangular region from 33rd and Walnut to 38th and Spruce st, as shown in Figure 1.
